# Horiseon Code Refactor
My challenge was an on-the-job ticket. It was my first challenge and I had to practice how to create a new repository, clone it and refactor the code in VS code editor. 
My TA, Trinh Nguyen, advised me that the first few div elements needed to be replaced with header and nav, and helped me commit and push these changes. The rest of the code refactoring I did myself.

## Acceptance Criteria:
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
